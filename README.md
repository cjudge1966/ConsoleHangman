# ConsoleHangman
A console hangman game.

When I founded the Austin .NET Meetup, I wanted to help people to learn C# and .NET. To do this, I started 
"Code Swaps". At a meetup, we would pick a small, but non-trivial problem like, "write a hangman game." 
Before the next meetup, We would all write (or attempt to write) a program that solves the problem and 
would then exchange questions and solutions at the next meetup.

The best way to learn to program is to actually write programs. And even something as trivial as a hangman 
game can lead to interesting questions and elegant solutions.
